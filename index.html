                    Dallas, city, Dallas, Collin, Denton, Rockwell, and Kaufman counties, seat (1846) of Dallas county, north-central Texas, U.S.
                    It lies along the Trinity River near the junction of that river’s three forks, in a region of prairies, tree-lined creeks and rivers, and gentle hills.
                    Its winters are mild with brief cold spells, but summers are hot with moderate to high humidity.
                    Dallas is the state’s third most populous city (after Houston and San Antonio) and the metropolis of the sprawling Dallas–Fort Worth urban area, known locally as the Metroplex.
                    Fort Worth lies 30 miles (48 km) west; other major cities in the metropolitan region include Arlington, Carrollton, Denton, Garland, Grand Prairie, Irving, Lewisville, Mesquite, Plano, Richardson, and University Park.

                    Due to the diverse population in Dallas there are plenty of options around.
                    I particularly enjoy mexican and thai the most.
                    Velvet Taco, Sabaidee Lao and Gloria's Latin Cuisine are some of the best mexican and thai restaurants
